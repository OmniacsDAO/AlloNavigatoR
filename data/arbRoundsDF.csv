To be clear, you do not have to be researching DAOs or Web3 specifically as long as the outcomes of your research have implications on or learnings for those working in digital and decentralized governance. This round was made possible with the generous support of Arbitrum, Uniswap, and MetagovDAO. This is not required, but any research that can address questions relevant to Arbitrum or the Uniswap Foundation is much appreciated.","You are a researcher. To qualify for this round you need to have a track record of research. This can be as part of an academic affiliation or as an independent researcher. If you are applying for a grant for your first research project, email hello@metagov.org with more info on why you are the right person to conduct this research. 
Governance focus for the research. We will only accept grants that have a clear focus on governance. As noted in the description, you don’t necessarily need to focus exclusively on DAO or web3 governance, but your research needs to be applicable to decentralized governance broadly. A focus on Arbitrum or Uniswap is appreciated but not required. 
No for-profit funding. If you have received VC funding or any other kind of funding that requires a return on investment, then it will not qualify. It is ok if you’ve received other grants.

We provide funding for ideas and projects that have the potential for significant positive impact in the Livepeer ecosystem and the future of open media technology, applications and experiences.

Anyone can apply for a Livepeer grant: individuals, independent teams, non-profits, companies, universities, and academics.","Open Source: Projects must have some open source component to them, whether a GitHub repo, a blog post or video talking about the project or any relevant findings, or some other public-facing learning for the rest of the community to learn from.
Showcase-able: projects must have something publishable to demonstrate completeness of the grant. This might be a website in production, a blog post, a published video, etc.
Powered by Livepeer: Grantees must display a ""Powered by Livepeer"" watermark, when applicable, to their completed projects. If the project is a video application using Livepeer’s transcoding network, the watermark must be visible while a viewer is watching the video, whether that's in the player itself or in another location that would be easily seen by a viewer.",bafkreico4xgx233rzrqqmhcwa73vejclj2ethlui725fbnm4pyehf5jd2e,1701388800,115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
